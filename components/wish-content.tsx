          Like a butterfly, I hope to spread my wings and soar into the next
          chapter of my life, filling each day with joy, laughter and adventure.
          May this seventeenth year bring me wisdom, courage and resilience to
          navigate life&apos;s challenges. I&apos;m excited to unfold my wings,
          explore new horizons, discover hidden talents, and create
          unforgettable memories with loved ones. May this year be a
          transformative journey of self-discovery, growth and happiness. May I
          learn to embrace my strengths, overcome weaknesses and shine brighter.
          I&apos;m grateful for family, friends and experiences that shaped me.
          Here&apos;s to an incredible year of learning, laughing, loving and
          growing!
